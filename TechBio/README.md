# What is TechBio #

In last 20 plus years we have seen incredible growth in biotechnology. BioTech has been around all of us for after almost 100 years, since the word BioTech came into the existance around 1919. 
And now, after 100+ years later we are talking about TechBio.

You must have heard about TechBio in the last few years. You must be excited to know what is it and how its going to impact you... In this video our objective is to learn more about Tech Bio beyond its defintion and it's impact to our future. 

We have to understand TechBio from two different angels. To make it simple to understand, lets visualize it in the form of yin-yang, where we will cover yin part fist...

So before I go further and explain it deeper, let me tell you 3 amazing results which are the marriage between biology and technology including computer science, cloud, data engineering, AI and ML... 

Just around the start of this century, the cost of a single DNA sequencing was about $100M and now today you can get your full GNOME sequence in a TEXT file for just about $100 stored into a $5 microSD card smaller then the size of a penny. Isn't it amazing to see the advances just in 20 years or so. 

During the very recent COVID-19 pandemic, scientists of all kinds, all over the world, worked together to generate a vaccine just about under 2 years which is almost the 20% of the time for a vaccine to make publically available due to whatever reason where there in past...  And now there are several Biotech and BioInformatics Startups working hard to generate various vaccines within 2-3 years model from start to finish. This amazing feet is going to open the gate for much needed route to acheive 200 years of life expactacy or longivity in next 20-50 years for sure.  

And finally the most of above all is the DeepMind's AlphaFold which has super high degree to predict the shape of protein through AI models. We as common population are not able to realize the true impact of DeepMind alphaFold however in coming years we will see it very differently.  

AlphaFold is a once in a generation advance, predicting protein structures with incredible speed and precision. This is what told by Arthur D. Levinson, the Former Chairman and CEO of Genentech. 

So these 3 different results were possible with the marrige of Biology and Computer Technolgy which we also refer as Computational Biology. The main areas where the computational biology is applied, are CRISPR, Achiving logivity, and immunotherepy.. 

About achieving longivity, I really like this billboard just outside San Francisco International Airport at highway 101, which I used to see everyday when I was driving to San Francisco from my home at San Mateo. It proves that great minds are at work.. 


Now lets take a look a look at the other angle, or the yang side of understanding...

In last several years we have seen the immense growth into Bio Platforms. So what are the BioPlatforms. Bio platforms are the combination of Software, A massive collection of biological data, and finally the intellectual properity specific to Biological advance, something a company has built as its core and the differenciator among other competitors. 

So combining Biological Intellectual Property or BioIP, sofware and biological data these companies are able to create a platform which has opened opportunities for creating new products, new partnerships, news market places and direct to customer products i.e. get your own DNA sequenced for just 100 dollars. 

Few examples of such Bio platform models are Benchling, 23andMe, Mammoth BioScienes, Bio-RAD, Broad Institute, Illumina and many more. 

After covering both the Yin and Yang to understand our topic from both sides, now we have enough fundamentals to understand what is TechBio.. 

TechBio is a combination of 3 different but internally connected disciplines, First is Digital Bio, The second is Machine Learning, which heavily foccused on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, and the 3rd and final is Biology Automation or BioMation. 

Now lets take a look at the each discipline individualy...

First Digital Bio, which is the the combination of technolgies i.e. CRISPR, DNA sequencing and Synthesis. The idea behing digital bio with CRISPR is to edit the GNOME sequence for reasons like learning more about person genetic profile and various other health specific details, Gnome defined medicine.  
Second, Machine Learning which includes Artificial Intelligence and computer vision, assist to unlock century old problems and expedite in delivering results through computer softwares and advance computer assisted modeling. 
And the 3rd is automation, which can be termed as bio-automation or biomation, in which, with the help of massive amount of biological data organizations can create future products i.e. creating new vaccines with heavy dependency on compter models, develop complex drug interactions to develop new drugs, and using computer models to expedtie the drug impact on humans which will reduce to the drug trials from several years to just a few years or less.  

So now you know what is TechBio, that all we had to cover in this video. 

This video content is the culmination of the information provided by various organizations i.e. NFX, DeepMind, Benchling, Mammoth-bio, Illumina and many others. I do apprecite their assistance to create this video content. 

Please visit these organization to learn more about these and various other topics we have covered in this video.

Thanks for your time and I am looking forward to see you in my next tech video.
Until then, please be good and do good.
